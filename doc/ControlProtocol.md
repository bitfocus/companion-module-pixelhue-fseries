This cmd can be sliced as : cmd_part1 + cmd_part_len + cmd_part2 + cmd_part_xx + cmd_part3 + cmd_part_sum

1. build `cmd_part_xx` and `cmd_part_len` by preset index.
2. calculate checksum, get `cmd_part_sum`.
3. pack all parts, get cmd to be sent.

Preset index -> 0xLEN_L,0xLEN_H

- preset 1: 3B 00
- preset 2: 3C 00
- preset 3: 3D 00

All variable part -> Checksum.
Checksum = SUM_L + SUM_H<<8 = LEN_L + LEN_H + XX + 0x6465
